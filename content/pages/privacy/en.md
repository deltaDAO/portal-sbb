# 5. Cookies and web storage

A cookie is a small file that stores Internet settings. Your web browser downloads it on the first visit to a website. The next time you open this website with the same device, the cookie and the information stored in it are either sent back to the website that created it (first-party cookie) or sent to another website it belongs to (third-party cookie). This enables the website to detect that you have opened it previously with this browser and, in some cases, to vary the displayed content.

Our portal demonstrator does not use cookies for analytics or marketing purposes.

We use local storage and session storage, which have similar functionality to cookies. We use your web storage to remember your page preferences, enable functionalities and to enhance your user experience. Your browser will remove the session storage once you close your browser.
