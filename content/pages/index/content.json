[Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com) is a fully open-source technology stack, leveraging DLT and decentralization, aiming to give control back to the owners of data services. This MVG demonstrator is built on top of Ocean Protocol showcasing how a Minimal Viable Gaia-X on DLT and Ocean Protocol can look like, already today.",

Compute-to-Data is the functionality that solves the current trade-off between the benefits of using private data and the risks of exposing it. It allows data consumers to run compute jobs on private data while the data stays on-premise with the data provider.",
