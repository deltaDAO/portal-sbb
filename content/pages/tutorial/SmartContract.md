A Smart Contract is a program that runs on a decentralized computer. When people or devices agree to use a smart contract, the program will perform the given action it was programmed to do if agreed conditions are met. This saves time, money, and limits conflicts when doing business with others.

A Smart Contract is a program that automatically performs transactions based on predetermined conditions, exactly as agreed. &quot;If a transaction was received, access is granted&quot;.

Smart contracts are especially useful for managing data workflows and data access control across people, teams, and companies, because they run in a way that is deterministic. This means that once the smart contract is deployed, it will run exactly as agreed when the conditions are triggered.

**A data vending machine.** A Smart Contract could grant acces to data (transaction) once a payment was received (predetermined condition), regardless of its source (accessible by anyone). Such a contract could be called a &quot;data vending machine&quot;. This smart contract will always deliver access to the data if it has received a payment.

**Verifiability.** The agreement in the smart contract, its trigger conditions, and the operations it does are all publicly verifiable on the blockchain. In our previous example, everyone could track if and how the data was accessed and verify that the access conditions were met. The blockchain stores all transactions related to all smart contracts, providing cryptographic proof of everything that happened.
