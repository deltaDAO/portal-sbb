title: Gaia-X as a Decentralized Autonomos Organization (DAO)
chapter: 15
---

An organization structures and coordinates people, material resources, and information based on specialization to achieve a goal. A DAO is an organization form expressed as software. Its purpose is to facilitate coordination via collective ownership. It services pre-defined goals, and groups use it to reduce coordination failure.

**Collectively Owned**. A DAO is collectively owned, controlled, and managed by its members. A set of smart contracts implementing voting mechanisms and proposal creation enable governance. Rules are pre-defined and enforced through code. So there is no need to trust its members.

**Treasury Management**. A built-in treasury protected by smart contracts with transparent rules defines how funds can be spent. Each transaction is logged in a transparent and tamper-proof way on a decentralized ledger. Any spending is governed by software code. This means that funds can be locked to be used only for specific purposes. Transactions that meet certain requirements might need the approval of the group to happen. DAOs allow a native implementation of these features.

The Gaia-X Operating Model has defined a set of Critical Success Factors (CSFs).  A DAO is capable of implementing these factors:

1. It must provide clear and unambiguous added values to the participants.

2. It must have a transparent governance model with identified accountability and liability.
3. It must be easy to use by its participants.

4. It must be financially sustainable for the participants and the Gaia-X Association.

Based on the objective and constraints to achieve those objectives, Gaia-X Association aims to create a Gaia-X DAO. It suggests utilizing a Gaia-X Distributed ledger to provide a decentralized network with smart contract functionality. A set of smart contracts and oracles could enforce a minimal set of rules to implement interoperability and governance among participants and ecosystems.

Those rules embrace validating self-descriptions, issuing labels, and discovering and registering on the Gaia-X network. This includes the operation of a decentralized and easily searchable catalogue. Gaia-X Catalogue providers should comply with these rules and filter out the inappropriate content by using a membership rule list maintained and provided by Gaia-X.
