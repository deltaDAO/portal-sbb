title: Gaia-X Federated Services
chapter: 14
---

Gaia-X aims to be a decentralized, secure, transparent digital ecosystem for the European data economy. Digital services and data can be shared easily and securely by any public or private institution without sacrificing data protection, privacy, and European values. As data has the potential to become the single most valuable good of our time, Gaia-X will significantly contribute to the economic welfare of all Europeans in the coming decades.

This is achieved through a multitude of interoperable platforms that all follow minimum technical requirements and services known as the Gaia-X federated services. Ocean Protocol already supports a wide range of functionalities the Gaia-X federated services (GXFS) aim to provide. It also works well with Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) and Verifiable Credentials (VC). Ocean Protocol might allow the Gaia-X community and emerging European data economy to save years of development and integration time. This time and resources could be used following an iterative and agile approach of continuous improvement.

Europe needs an operating, open and secure data economy to remain innovative and internationally competitive. Ocean Protocol can be the steppingstone, as it provides many of the functionalities the Gaia-X federated services aim to provide already. It offers a functional, fully open-sourced foundation to develop a Minimal Viable Gaia-X towards a fully-fledged data economy following European values. Every contributor of the Gaia-X community can integrate existing solutions, add new components, and implement new use cases for the future European data economy. Today.

**1. Identity and Trust.** As most DLT solutions, Ocean Protocol relies on Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) and works well with verifiable credentials (VC). This allows users to retain control of their identity and adds a new level of trust and security.

**2. Federated Catalogue.** Ocean Protocol metadata smart contracts provide a decentralized database and &quot;ground truth&quot; for all data asset self-descriptions. This includes a fully operational federated catalogue (FC) and inter-catalogue synchronization on the application layer.

**3. Sovereign Data Exchange.** Ocean Protocol enables Data Contract Services (DCS) based on Smart Contracts. These allow providers and consumers to offer, negotiate and stipulate data contracts and execute data access rights in a transparent and secure manner. Compute-to-Data (CtD), as part of the Ocean Protocol core features, allows data service providers to always stay in control of their data. CtD enables data owners to grant only compute access to their data. The data itself remains with the data owner in a secured environment.

**4. Data Exchange Logging.** Using DLT, all transactions are verified, stored, and audited in an ordered, transparent, and trustless way, thus enabled the Data Exchange Logging Service (DELS).

**5. Portal &amp; Integration.** Only a user-friendly tool for discovery and interaction with data assets will allow for widespread adoption and acceptance of Gaia-X services. Ocean Protocol delivers an open-source, customizable web frontend and APIs to interact with. Users can start publishing and consuming data services with not much more than a standard browser at their disposal.

**6. Security &amp; Privacy by Design.** As a DLT application and protocol, based on a trustless environment and SSI, Ocean Protocol features security and privacy by design. It does not collect any more information about the participants than is needed to facilitate its services.
