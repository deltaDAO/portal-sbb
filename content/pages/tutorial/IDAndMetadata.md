**Metadata and Asset Self Description.** When vast amounts of data are available in data markets, it becomes essential to effectively search and find suitable datasets. Metadata and Asset Self Descriptions enable that. Both are created during the publishing process in Ocean Protocol.

**Dataset management**. Ocean Protocol offers different tools to customize the description of the data. Each dataset has a decentralized identifier called a DID, which points to a DID document (DDO) that stores the metadata. The DDO is a JSON file that holds the asset self-description.

A DID identifies your asset in the entire Gaia-X/Ocean Ecosystem. Each asset has a different DID, as DIDs are generated by hashing your metadata into a hex string (e.g., MD5, [checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum)).
